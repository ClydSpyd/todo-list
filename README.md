INTRODUCTION

The to-do-list app is a simple and attractive application with a clean, minimalist UI which allows a user to list and manage their pending tasks.

The app provides basic functionality – the ability to list tasks, mark tasks as complete and filter tasks by pending, complete or all. Until such time as a task is deleted from the list, it persists in the user’s local storage. 

The app can be viewed and tested here:
